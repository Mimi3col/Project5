## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was able to get the search bar working and displaying 12 days of data from a given zip code. each box will show the High and low temp as well as the average temp for the given day. Next I will be implementing a filter so that the user is able to see the ranking of the days from highs average temp to lowest average temp.
